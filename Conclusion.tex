\chapter{Conclusion}

In the past 4 months of the internship, we were able to test the IIDEAA framework extensively, thus detected some problems around it, regarding many aspects such as the core code base, run-time issue, conflicting dependencies between run-time environment and some of the projects. From the results obtained from applying the framework to some of the AxBench's benchmark, we can further validate that choosing an suitable mutation operator is crucial when trying to utilize Approximate Computing. In addition, FANN has proven to be a Artificial Neural Network library that is compatible with IIDEAA to a certain extend. Nevertheless, further experiment might needed to see whether IIDEAA can apply Approximate Computing to everything in the library. \\

In the last 2 months of the internship, we planning to develop a tool that can generate separate variants of the mutated source code based on the result of Bellerophon. This tool will be helpful when it comes to a point that manually editting the source code will become infeasible due to either the large amounts of acceptable results or operators to modify. \\

In the future, we hope to cover all of the fore-mentioned drawbacks of IIDEAA, especially moving IIDEAA to a better run-time environment with the latest LLVM version as well as some other dependencies that were holding us back during the past few months. Developing a new Approxmiate Operator is also desired as we would like to have more versatility within IIDEAA.\\
