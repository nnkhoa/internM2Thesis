Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Learning is becoming popular than ever due to their great result in complex tasks such as object recognition in images/videos, natural language processing or playing sophisticated games like chess. However, they come with the cost of consuming a lot of time and energy while demand high-end hardwares.\\
In recent years, Approximate Computing(AxC) has become a major research topic in High Performance Computing in order to solve the problem of time/energy efficiency in popular computer science applications, as it focuses on trading the best precision of the calculation for less time/energy consumption, obtaining an approximated result that can still satisfy the application's need. \\
The internship emphasises on utilizing and further extending IIDEAA, an automated framework, to identify suitable portions of the Neural Network for Approximate Computing and generate variants of the source code in order to compare and choose the best version of the approximation.\\
